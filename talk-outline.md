# Investigating parameter identifiability and "sloppiness" in a dynamical model of reading

## SWIFT

## (Practical) Identifiability

## Sloppiness

## Methods

### Profile likelihoods

### Bias and coefficient of variation

### Hessian method

#### Near-redundancy

## Solutions

### More data

### Reparameterize model

- Sloppiness is responsive to scale of parameters, so if possible, have them all on approx. same order of magnitude, or log-transform

#### Fix parameter to reasonable values

#### Minimally disruptive curves to eliminate parameter (combinations)

### Slap on some priors

## Results with SWIFT

## Conclusion
