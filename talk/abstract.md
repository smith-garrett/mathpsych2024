# Investigating parameter identifiability and "sloppiness" in a dynamical model of reading

Theories of many cognitive processes can be expressed as dynamical process models. In order
to test the hypotheses that the models implement, we must calibrate them to experimental
data by fitting free parameters. In this work, we study a version of the SWIFT model of
eye-movement control during reading (Engbert et al., 2005, Psych. Rev.; Engbert & Rabe,
2023, under review) to illustrate two related issues that can arise in models with multiple
free parameters: parameter identifiability and sloppiness. The parameters of a model are
identifiable for a given data set when it is possible to find a finite confidence interval
for the parameter (Raue et al., 2009, Bioninformatics). When a parameter is
non-identifiable, parameter fitting can be difficult and misleading, even if the fitted
model's output looks reasonable. Sloppiness arises when there are large differences in
how sensitive the model's output is to changes in different parameters (Brown & Sethna,
2003, Phys. Rev. E). Sloppiness can also lead to difficulty in model calibration and
make interpreting model output challenging, as an analysis of sloppiness often reveals
that there are combinations of parameters that vary systematically together with no
change in the model's predictions. To our knowledge, parameter identifiability and
sloppiness have received little attention in cognitive science, even though the
structure of many models is susceptible to these problems. In this talk, we will discuss
methods for identifying and addressing parameter non-identifiability and model
sloppiness, which can lead to simpler models and more informative fits to experimental
data.
